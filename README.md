# Match3Solver


## Overview

**Match3Solver** is a C++ project aimed at solving Match-3 puzzles, similar to popular games like Candy Crush. The project provides a framework to analyze and determine optimal moves to achieve high scores or clear levels efficiently.
This project is not the most flashiest in my repo but it is the one I am most proud of. I used to play this card game where you needed to match 3 cards in a gird of 8x5. The socres were distributed similar to tho popular card game (3-patti). 
I was very bad at that game. I wanted to build something that could play this game perfectly but I could not at the time.
I did build it now but I dont even play that game anymore. This same idea can be extended to other match 3 games like candycrush.


## Features

- **Table Management:** Handles the game board representation and operations.
- **Card Handling:** Manages individual game pieces and their properties.
- **Deck Operations:** Manages collections of game pieces and their interactions.
- **Main Solver Logic:** Implements algorithms to find optimal moves.
